# Upinus Challenge - UBot

**Prerequisites:**
- Solve this with Python3
- Push your work to a Github repo, make sure you show progress with commits
- Feel free to use the internet to look up any coding references
- Please do not ask anyone else for help. We want to see how you code, it's more important.
- Max time is 4 hours, don't worry if not done just stop wherever you're then send Github repo to dev@upinus.com

Upinus has built a robot called UBot which walks in 2-dimensional plane (X, Y coordinate).

It can only turn left or right, and walk straight.
It also knows of its current position (X, Y) as well as its direction (North, East, West and South).

In order to command UBot to walk, it must be input with a walking command. The walking command can be represented with a string consisting of three alphabets R, L and W and a positive integer N to indicate the distance of how many positions it has to walk which can be explained as follows:

```
R: Turn 90 degree to the right of UBot (clockwise)
L: Turn 90 degree to the left of UBot (counterclockwise)
WN: Walk straight for N point(s) where N can be any positive integers. For example, W1 means walking straight for 1 point.
```

Initial Conditions:

```
UBot starts at the position (X, Y) of 0, 0
UBot is facing up North
```

For example, the walking code of RW15RW1 means

```
UBot starts at 0, 0 facing up North.
UBot turns right (facing East) and walk straight 15 positions.
UBot turns another right (now facing South) and walk straight 1 position.
Your task is to create a command-line based script in any programming language of your choice. The script accepts a command line argument as an input string of the walking code and print out the result of the last position (X, Y) of UBot and its last facing direction (North, East, West or South).
```

Note that the output is case-sensitive.

A sample of a running script in a terminal with the input of RW15RW1:

```
> python ubot.py RW15RW1
> X: 15 Y: -1 Direction: South
```
